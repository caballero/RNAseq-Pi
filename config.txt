# Pipeline definition, each subprocess is performed in the order of the lines,
# one instruction by line and marked by "step" at the beginning.
# Operations are:
#    preprocess -> perform some operation to the sequences (masking, trim, ...)
#    filterProp -> remove reads with filters (low quality, low complexity)
#    filterSeq  -> remove reads with homology to a reference
#    mapper     -> align reads to a reference
#    mixSAM     -> combine SAM files
#    finish     -> finish the process
